Database Migration:

Each time the database models change, repeat the migrate and upgrade commands
    >> flask db init  						                // create a migration directory
    >> flask db migrate -m "name of migration message"		// generate migration script with the latest schema
    >> flask db upgrade					                    // apply migration script to database
    >> DELETE FROM alembic_version;                         // if you want to delete previous migration history
